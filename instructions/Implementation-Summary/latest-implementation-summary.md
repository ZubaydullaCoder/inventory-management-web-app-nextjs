Implementation Summary

1. Edit Modal UX and State Management
   Flicker-Free Save Button: Refactored the "Save Changes" button logic in the product edit modal to prevent flickering by only disabling it during actual user edits and validation, not during initial data load.
   Consistent Select Inputs: Ensured that category and selling unit select inputs always display the current value (never a placeholder) when the modal opens, for a stable and predictable UX.
   Optimistic Modal Close: The edit modal now closes immediately (optimistically) when a product is deleted, matching the behavior for edits.
2. Debounced Name Validation
   External Debounce Package: Replaced the custom debounce implementation with the popular use-debounce npm package for product name uniqueness validation, improving reliability and maintainability.
   Consistent Validation: Name validation is debounced and only blocks submission when the user actually changes the name, not on initial load.
3. General Patterns and Best Practices
   Separation of Concerns (SoC): UI logic, API calls, and business logic are kept in their respective layers (components, hooks, services).
   Reusability: Shared logic (e.g., debounced validation) is encapsulated in custom hooks or replaced with well-maintained external packages.
   Optimistic UI: Both product edits and deletes use optimistic updates for immediate feedback, with rollback on error.
   User Feedback: All major actions (save, delete, validation) provide clear, immediate feedback via button states and toast notifications.
   Form State Initialization: All form fields are initialized with sensible defaults to prevent uncontrolled state and UI flicker.
   Consistent API Integration: All form actions (create, update, delete) use the same API and mutation patterns, ensuring maintainability.
4. Codebase Hygiene
   Removed Redundant Code: The custom debounce hook was deleted after switching to the external package.
   Atomic Commits: All changes were committed and pushed to GitHub with clear, descriptive messages.
   Patterns Applied:

Use of external, reliable packages over custom code
Optimistic UI for better perceived performance
Clean separation of UI, business logic, and API layers
DRY and modular code structure
Immediate and clear user feedback for all actions
Result:
The product edit and creation flows are now more robust, user-friendly, and maintainable, with a codebase that adheres to modern React and architectural best practices.
