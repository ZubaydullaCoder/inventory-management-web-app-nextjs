# Phase 0 Summary: Discovery & Authentication (The Front Door)

## Overview

Phase 0 established the public-facing presence and secure authentication system for the Retail Inventory & Finance Manager app. The goal was to enable new users to visit the landing page, understand the product's value, and sign up for a 14-day free trial using Google OAuth, with a seamless, secure, and modern user experience.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Landing Page & Layout

- **Visuals:** The landing page at `/` renders the Header, Hero, Features, Pricing, CTA, and Footer sections, following the UI/UX and Design System guides.
- **Responsiveness:** Fully responsive design, tested on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Branding:** Consistent use of the primary color (`#359EFF`) and "Inter" font across all UI elements.
- **Section-Based Architecture:** The landing page is composed of focused section components (`hero-section.jsx`, `features-section.jsx`, `pricing-section.jsx`, `quick-actions-section.jsx`, `cta-section.jsx`), orchestrated by a lean `HomePage` server component for maintainability and clarity.

### 2. Authentication Flow

- **Intercepting Route Modal:** All "Start Free Trial" and "Login" buttons use Next.js `<Link>` to `/login`, which triggers an intercepting modal (`AuthModal`) without leaving the landing page context.
- **Google OAuth:** The modal provides a "Continue with Google" button, initiating the Google OAuth flow via NextAuth.js.
- **Database Integration:** On first sign-in, a new `User` and a linked `Subscription` (status `TRIAL`, 14-day expiry) are created in the database using Prisma.
- **Redirection:** Successful authentication redirects the user to `/dashboard`.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Reloading `/login` redirects to `/` (no fallback page is shown).
  - Authentication failures display a non-intrusive error notification using `sonner`.
  - Authenticated users are redirected to `/dashboard` if they attempt to access `/` or `/login`.

### 3. Backend & Database

- **Prisma Schema:** Models for `User` and `Subscription` with correct fields and relations.
- **Secure API:** Auth endpoints (`/api/auth/*`) are protected, and JWT session cookies are `HttpOnly` and secure.
- **Environment:** All required environment variables are managed in `.env.local`.

## Applied Best Practices

- **Separation of Concerns:**
  - Each landing page section is a dedicated component, improving readability and maintainability.
  - The `HomePage` component only orchestrates layout and data fetching.
- **Server Components by Default:**
  - All route-level and section components are server components unless client interactivity is required.
- **Design System Adherence:**
  - Consistent use of shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS, and the Inter font.
  - Color palette and spacing follow the design system.
- **Authentication Security:**
  - Auth.js (NextAuth) is configured with Google OAuth, JWT session strategy, and secure callbacks.
  - Middleware enforces route protection and proper redirection for authenticated/unauthenticated users.
- **Database Integrity:**
  - Prisma migrations ensure schema consistency and data integrity.
  - User and Subscription creation is atomic and handled in the authentication callback.
- **User Experience:**
  - Intercepting modal for authentication provides a seamless, SPA-like experience.
  - Error handling is user-friendly and non-intrusive.
- **File & Directory Naming:**
  - kebab-case for directories and files, PascalCase for React components, as per workspace conventions.
- **CLI Usage:**
  - All setup and component generation leveraged CLI tools (npm, npx shadcn, prisma) where possible.

## Outcome

Phase 0 delivers a robust, modern, and secure entry point for the application, setting a strong foundation for future development. The codebase is organized, maintainable, and follows industry best practices for Next.js, authentication, and UI architecture.

**Next Steps:**

- Proceed to Phase 1: Core Dashboard, Inventory, and Sales features implementation.
