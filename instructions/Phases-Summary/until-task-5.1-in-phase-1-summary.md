# Phase 1 Implementation Summary: Inventory Management Core (Up to Task 5.1)

## 1. Core Features & Layouts

- **Authenticated Dashboard Layout:**
  - Implemented `/dashboard` layout with sidebar, topbar, and modal slot for intercepting routes.
  - Sidebar is fully responsive and collapsible.
- **Onboarding Guide:**
  - Added onboarding component to guide new users through initial setup.
- **Cockpit Creation Workflows:**
  - Built two-column cockpit pages for Products and Categories (form + session list).
  - Server Components orchestrate layout; Client Components handle forms and lists.

## 2. CRUD & Data Table Integrations

- **Products & Categories:**
  - Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implemented for both resources.
  - API endpoints (`/api/products`, `/api/categories`) use Zod validation and shared service/data functions.
  - DataTable (TanStack Table v8) powers all tabular views, with custom columns, actions, and filtering.
  - Modal editing via intercepting routes (parallel routing) for seamless UX.

## 3. State Management & Data Fetching

- **TanStack Query Integration:**
  - All client-side state (lists, session data) managed via TanStack Query.
  - Query keys standardized in `/src/lib/queryKeys.js` for cache consistency.
  - Server Components fetch initial data directly from service functions (not API routes), following the hybrid pattern.
  - API routes call the same service functions for client-driven fetches/mutations.

## 4. Optimistic Updates & UX

- **Optimistic Mutations:**
  - Product creation and editing use optimistic updates for instant UI feedback and rollback on error.
  - Session list for new products updates immediately after form submit.
  - DataTable reflects edits instantly; pagination and cache structure fixed for correct optimistic reconciliation.
- **Accessibility:**
  - All modals include accessible DialogTitle (with VisuallyHidden for loading/error states).

## 5. Issue Fixes & Improvements

- **Query Key Mismatches:**
  - Fixed mismatches so optimistic updates and DataTable use the same cache entry.
- **Session List Bug:**
  - Prevented unnecessary query invalidation that wiped the session list after mutation.
- **Pagination Bug:**
  - Ensured cache always contains the full paginated object, not just an array, for correct DataTable and optimistic update behavior.
- **Form Reset:**
  - Product creation form resets immediately after submission for rapid entry.

## 6. Packages & Best Practices

- **External Packages:**
  - Integrated `@tanstack/react-query`, `@tanstack/react-table`, `@radix-ui/react-visually-hidden`, and `nanoid` for robust state, table, accessibility, and ID generation.
- **Code Organization:**
  - Logic moved to `/components/features/`, `/lib/services/`, and `/lib/utils/` for maintainability.
  - All API routes and service functions follow Zod validation and consistent error handling (see Backend Design System guide).

## 7. GitHub & Versioning

- All major milestones and fixes committed and pushed to GitHub.

**Result:**
The app now provides a robust, modern inventory management experience with best-in-class UX for data entry, editing, and management, following workspace and industry best practices. All core flows (Products, Categories) are complete and ready for further resource expansion (Suppliers, Customers) in subsequent tasks.
